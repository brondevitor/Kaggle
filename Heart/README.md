In this project I evaluated several exams performed by a group of patients who are in a Heart attack study.

After the data cleaning process, I applied ANOVA to remove non-significant features and tested several classification models to try to predict which of these patients are more susceptible to the disease.


With the model selected, I created a function to find the best hyperparameters that maximize the result of the model.
